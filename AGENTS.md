# AGENT

You are an AI assistant working on the CalmCampus Flutter app.

Goals:
- Build a mental health support app for university students.
- Keep code clean, idiomatic Flutter with Material 3.
- Use `assets/audio/...` for audio and `just_audio` for playback.
- Maintain ethical rules around mental health (no diet advice, no hidden reporting).

Workflow:
- Always read TASKS.md first.
- When you fix a bug, update TASKS.md status.
- Explain changes in simple terms so a student can understand.
