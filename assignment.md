## Scenario

Mental health awareness has become a critical topic, especially in academic environments where students face high pressure, deadline stress, and social anxiety. Market analysis for 2025 shows a surge in demand for “pocket therapy” tools – apps that offer immediate, accessible support for anxiety management and mindfulness.

Your client, the Department Student Affairs (DSA), requires a prototype mobile application designed to support student mental well-being. They want an app that is not just a static information brochure, but an interactive tool that students can use daily to track their mood, access resources, and practice mindfulness.

You must develop a native or cross-platform mobile application that assists users in managing their mental well-being. The app must demonstrate:

- Robust technical implementation
- Adherence to UI/UX best practices for accessibility
- Strict consideration of ethical data handling
